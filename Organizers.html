            <h3>About the Organizers</h3>
            <p>
                Meet Ana(They/She) and Erin (They/Them).  Ana and Erin started Thems Trails after seeing a need to connect with other LGBTQ2SIA to offer a safe place to share in the activity they love: trail running. “We just wanted to be a part of a group that we felt safe in, for people like us (LGBTQIA2S), and so many groups are not willing to say this is a safe place for queer folks. We just want to be in a judgment-free group of people who want to trail run and where we can be ourselves.”
                <br><br>

                The group is open and is planning to be a non-profit if it catches on. “We don't want it to be about us. We want this to be a space for the community of runners who are LGBTQIA2S and allies to know that there are people who love trail running or want to get started but feel they don't have a safe, judgment-free place to enjoy the trails.
