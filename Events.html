                Them Trails is a community that values connection. We value
                community involvement and outdoor activities, and can't wait to share these experiences
                with all of you. We are committed to providing a safe and inclusive environment for all LGBTQIA2S+ folks and allies. We encourage everyone to join us and be part of our vibrant community.

                We have many events planned for the upcoming year, including trail runs from Aravaipa Running:
                Prickly Pedal, Black Canyon, and Whiskey Basin. In addition to trail runs, we
                have community service events and social gatherings. Check back often for updates!
