               <p><h3>Ten safety tips for the trails</h3></p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <p>
                            <li>Bring water. Bring up to a gallon for the run, and don't forget electrolytes.</li> <br>
                        
                            <li>Trail shoes. You need well-fitting trail shoes. Regular running shoes will not be suitable for some of the trails because the rocks are too slick. </li> <br>

                            <li>Bring an ice pack. An ice pack on your pressure point can help cool you fast if needed. </li> <br>

                            <li>Banda or cooling rag. Bring a cooling rag or bandana to help cool you down during the run. </li> <br>

                            <li>Sunscreen. Always use sunscreen, even when it is cloudy, because you can still burn. </li> <br>
                            
                            <li>Bring a snack. Be sure to bring a snack that won't spoil in the heat, like a Clif Bar or fruit. </li> <br>

                            <li>Check the weather. Check the weather so you know how to dress for your run. </li> <br>

                            <li>Lighting. Bring a headlamp for night running, and/or a safety light for visibility. </li> <br>

                            <li>Keep to the trails and be alert. Going off-trail is dangerous, and you can easily get lost when running. </li> <br>
                            
                            <li> Never go alone. The whole point of the theme trails is to connect with people who love to trail run. Splitting off from the group and running alone is dangerous.</li> <br>
                            <br>
